# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG config file - external config example

##
##   This config file is an example of external config (typical path: ~/.config/frogminer/proton-tkg.cfg)
##   It contains most available options in a centralized way - The few missing options are part of wine-tkg-git and mostly not interesting for proton-tkg
##

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../../wine-tkg-git/wine-tkg-profiles/sample-external-config.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"

# Set to the distro of your choice to attempt dependency resolution. Valid options are "debuntu" (for debian, ubuntu and similar), "fedora" or "archlinux".
_nomakepkg_dep_resolution_distro=""

# Set to true if you want to skip the uninstaller at the end of proton-tkg building
_skip_uninstaller="false"

# Set to true if you do not want your build to be automatically moved to your compatibilitytools.d dir
_no_autoinstall="false"

_proton_use_steamhelper="true"

# Set to true to disable proton's steamclient lib substitution. Allows running windows steam client in proton (only affects 4.19+)
