# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG simple config file

##
##   This config file contains the basic settings of your build.
##   For deeper configuration, see proton-tkg-profiles/advanced-customization.cfg

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../wine-tkg-git/customization.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"

# Enable dependency autoresolver for non-makepkg builds - Set to true to automatically install missing dependencies for your distro.
# This will autodetect your OS and install the required dependencies for building wine-tkg using the appropriate package manager.
# The autoresolver will also attempt to use the best available privileged escalation method for your system (sudo, doas, etc.)
_nomakepkg_dependency_autoresolver="true"

# Set to true if you want to skip the uninstaller at the end of proton-tkg building
_skip_uninstaller="false"

# Set to true if you do not want your build to be automatically moved to your compatibilitytools.d dir
_no_autoinstall="false"
