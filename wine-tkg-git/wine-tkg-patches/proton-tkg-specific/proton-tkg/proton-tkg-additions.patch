Subject: [PATCH] HACK: winex11.drv: Let the WM focus our windows by default.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This should fix game windows not being in focus when first started
and when exiting, which can cause surprising keyboard behavior (e.g.
accidentally Alt-F4ing Steam itself, which is in the background).

This may break modal dialogs in some WMs (fvwm2?) which do not respect
our responses to WM_TAKE_FOCUS. For games that show that issue, we can
re-enable UseTakeFocus.

From Zeb:

"""
The basic problem, if I understand it correctly, is that Wine uses the
"globally active" focus model by default. This means that the window
manager won't focus our windows unless we respond in the affirmative to
a WM_TAKE_FOCUS event. Since the GUI thread isn't processing messages,
this doesn't happen.

Luckily, there is a very easy workaround: create the registry key
HKCU\Software\Wine\X11 Driver and set the somewhat inaptly named value
"UseTakeFocus" to "N" (i.e. No). This causes Wine to use the "locally
active" model instead, which means that the window manager will focus
our windows when it sees fitâ€”i.e. when the user clicks on them, or when
they are created.
