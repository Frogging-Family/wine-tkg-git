-This is eventfd-based synchronization, or 'esync' for short. Turn it on with
-WINEESYNC=1; debug it with +esync.
-
-== BUGS AND LIMITATIONS ==
-
-Please let me know if you find any bugs. If you can, also attach a log with
-+seh,+pid,+esync,+server,+timestamp.
-
-If you get something like "eventfd: Too many open files" and then things start
-crashing, you've probably run out of file descriptors. esync creates one
-eventfd descriptor for each synchronization object, and some games may use a
-large number of these.  Linux by default limits a process to 4096 file
-descriptors, which probably was reasonable back in the nineties but isn't
-really anymore. (Fortunately Debian and derivatives [Ubuntu, Mint] already
-have a reasonable limit.) To raise the limit you'll want to edit
-/etc/security/limits.conf and add a line like
-
-* hard nofile 1048576
-
-then restart your session.
-
-On distributions using systemd, the settings in `/etc/security/limits.conf`
-will be overridden by systemd's own settings. If you run `ulimit -Hn` and it
-returns a lower number than the one you've previously set, then you can set
-
-DefaultLimitNOFILE=1048576
-
-in both `/etc/systemd/system.conf` and `/etc/systemd/user.conf`. You can then
-execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reexec` and restart your session. Check again
-with `ulimit -Hn` that the limit is correct.
-
-Also note that if the wineserver has esync active, all clients also must, and
-vice versa. Otherwise things will probably crash quite badly.
-
-== EXPLANATION ==
-
-The aim is to execute all synchronization operations in "user-space", that is,
-without going through wineserver. We do this using Linux's eventfd
-facility. The main impetus to using eventfd is so that we can poll multiple
-objects at once; in particular we can't do this with futexes, or pthread
-semaphores, or the like. The only way I know of to wait on any of multiple
-objects is to use select/poll/epoll to wait on multiple fds, and eventfd gives
-us those fds in a quite usable way.
-
-Whenever a semaphore, event, or mutex is created, we have the server, instead
-of creating a traditional server-side event/semaphore/mutex, instead create an
-'esync' primitive. These live in esync.c and are very slim objects; in fact,
-they don't even know what type of primitive they are. The server is involved
-at all because we still need a way of creating named objects, passing handles
-to another process, etc.
-
-The server creates an eventfd file descriptor with the requested parameters
-and passes it back to ntdll. ntdll creates an object of the appropriate type,
-then caches it in a table. This table is copied almost wholesale from the fd
-cache code in server.c.
-
-Specific operations follow quite straightforwardly from eventfd:
-
-* To release an object, or set an event, we simply write() to it.
-* An object is signalled if read() succeeds on it. Notably, we create all
-  eventfd descriptors with O_NONBLOCK, so that we can atomically check if an
-  object is signalled and grab it if it is. This also lets us reset events.
-* For objects whose state should not be reset upon waiting—e.g. manual-reset
-  events—we simply check for the POLLIN flag instead of reading.
-* Semaphores are handled by the EFD_SEMAPHORE flag. This matches up quite well
-  (although with some difficulties; see below).
-* Mutexes store their owner thread locally. This isn't reliable information if
-  a different process's thread owns the mutex, but this doesn't matter—a
-  thread should only care whether it owns the mutex, so it knows whether to
-  try waiting on it or simply to increase the recursion count.
-
-The interesting part about esync is that (almost) all waits happen in ntdll,
-including those on server-bound objects. The idea here is that on the server
-side, for any waitable object, we create an eventfd file descriptor (not an
-esync primitive), and then pass it to ntdll if the program tries to wait on
-it. These are cached too, so only the first wait will require a round trip to
-the server. Then the server signals the file descriptor as appropriate, and
-thereby wakes up the client. So far this is implemented for processes,
-threads, message queues (difficult; see below), and device managers (necessary
-for drivers to work). All of these are necessarily server-bound, so we
-wouldn't really gain anything by signalling on the client side instead. Of
-course, except possibly for message queues, it's not likely that any program
-(cutting-edge D3D game or not) is going to be causing a great wineserver load
-by waiting on any of these objects; the motivation was rather to provide a way
-to wait on ntdll-bound and server-bound objects at the same time.
-
-Some cases are still passed to the server, and there's probably no reason not
-to keep them that way. Those that I noticed while testing include: async
-objects, which are internal to the file APIs and never exposed to userspace,
-startup_info objects, which are internal to the loader and signalled when a
-process starts, and keyed events, which are exposed through an ntdll API
-(although not through kernel32) but can't be mixed with other objects (you
-have to use NtWaitForKeyedEvent()). Other cases include: named pipes, debug
-events, sockets, and timers. It's unlikely we'll want to optimize debug events
-or sockets (or any of the other, rather rare, objects), but it is possible
-we'll want to optimize named pipes or timers.
-
-There were two sort of complications when working out the above. The first one
-was events. The trouble is that (1) the server actually creates some events by
-itself and (2) the server sometimes manipulates events passed by the
-client. Resolving the first case was easy enough, and merely entailed creating
-eventfd descriptors for the events the same way as for processes and threads
-(note that we don't really lose anything this way; the events include
-"LowMemoryCondition" and the event that signals system processes to shut
-down). For the second case I basically had to hook the server-side event
-functions to redirect to esync versions if the event was actually an esync
-primitive.
-
-The second complication was message queues. The difficulty here is that X11
-signals events by writing into a pipe (at least I think it's a pipe?), and so
-as a result wineserver has to poll on that descriptor. In theory we could just
-let wineserver do so and then signal us as appropriate, except that wineserver
-only polls on the pipe when the thread is waiting for events (otherwise we'd
-get e.g. keyboard input while the thread is doing something else, and spin
-forever trying to wake up a thread that doesn't care). The obvious solution is
-just to poll on that fd ourselves, and that's what I did—it's just that
-getting the fd from wineserver was kind of ugly, and the code for waiting was
-also kind of ugly basically because we have to wait on both X11's fd and the
-"normal" process/thread-style wineserver fd that we use to signal sent
-messages. The upshot about the whole thing was that races are basically
-impossible, since a thread can only wait on its own queue.
-
-System APCs already work, since the server will forcibly suspend a thread if
-it's not already waiting, and so we just need to check for EINTR from
-poll(). User APCs and alertable waits are implemented in a similar style to
-message queues (well, sort of): whenever someone executes an alertable wait,
-we add an additional eventfd to the list, which the server signals when an APC
-arrives. If that eventfd gets signaled, we hand it off to the server to take
-care of, and return STATUS_USER_APC.
-
-Originally I kept the volatile state of semaphores and mutexes inside a
-variable local to the handle, with the knowledge that this would break if
-someone tried to open the handle elsewhere or duplicate it. It did, and so now
-this state is stored inside shared memory. This is of the POSIX variety, is
-allocated by the server (but never mapped there) and lives under the path
-"/wine-esync".
-
-There are a couple things that this infrastructure can't handle, although
-surprisingly there aren't that many. In particular:
-* Implementing wait-all, i.e. WaitForMultipleObjects(..., TRUE, ...), is not
-  exactly possible the way we'd like it to be possible. In theory that
-  function should wait until it knows all objects are available, then grab
-  them all at once atomically. The server (like the kernel) can do this
-  because the server is single-threaded and can't race with itself. We can't
-  do this in ntdll, though. The approach I've taken I've laid out in great
-  detail in the relevant patch, but for a quick summary we poll on each object
-  until it's signaled (but don't grab it), check them all again, and if
-  they're all signaled we try to grab them all at once in a tight loop, and if
-  we fail on any of them we reset the count on whatever we shouldn't have
-  consumed. Such a blip would necessarily be very quick.
-* The whole patchset only works on Linux, where eventfd is available. However,
-  it should be possible to make it work on a Mac, since eventfd is just a
-  quicker, easier way to use pipes (i.e. instead of writing 1 to the fd you'd
-  write 1 byte; instead of reading a 64-bit value from the fd you'd read as
-  many bytes as you can carry, which is admittedly less than 2**64 but
-  can probably be something reasonable.) It's also possible, although I
-  haven't yet looked, to use some different kind of synchronization
-  primitives, but pipes would be easiest to tack onto this framework.
-* PulseEvent() can't work the way it's supposed to work. Fortunately it's rare
-  and deprecated. It's also explicitly mentioned on MSDN that a thread can
-  miss the notification for a kernel APC, so in a sense we're not necessarily
-  doing anything wrong.
-
-There are some things that are perfectly implementable but that I just haven't
-done yet:
-* Other synchronizable server primitives. It's unlikely we'll need any of
-  these, except perhaps named pipes (which would honestly be rather difficult)
-  and (maybe) timers.
-* Access masks. We'd need to store these inside ntdll, and validate them when
-  someone tries to execute esync operations.
-
-This patchset was inspired by Daniel Santos' "hybrid synchronization"
-patchset. My idea was to create a framework whereby even contended waits could
-be executed in userspace, eliminating a lot of the complexity that his
-synchronization primitives used. I do however owe some significant gratitude
-toward him for setting me on the right path.
-
-I've tried to maximize code separation, both to make any potential rebases
-easier and to ensure that esync is only active when configured. All code in
-existing source files is guarded with "if (do_esync())", and generally that
-condition is followed by "return esync_version_of_this_method(...);", where
-the latter lives in esync.c and is declared in esync.h. I've also tried to
-make the patchset very clear and readable—to write it as if I were going to
-submit it upstream. (Some intermediate patches do break things, which Wine is
-generally against, but I think it's for the better in this case.) I have cut
-some corners, though; there is some error checking missing, or implicit
-assumptions that the program is behaving correctly.
-
-I've tried to be careful about races. There are a lot of comments whose
-purpose are basically to assure me that races are impossible. In most cases we
-don't have to worry about races since all of the low-level synchronization is
-done by the kernel.
-
-Anyway, yeah, this is esync. Use it if you like.

-/* Manual-reset events are actually racier than other objects in terms of shm
- * state. With other objects, races don't matter, because we only treat the shm
- * state as a hint that lets us skip poll()—we still have to read(). But with
- * manual-reset events we don't, which means that the shm state can be out of
- * sync with the actual state.
- *
- * In general we shouldn't have to worry about races between modifying the
- * event and waiting on it. If the state changes while we're waiting, it's
- * equally plausible that we caught it before or after the state changed.
- * However, we can have races between SetEvent() and ResetEvent(), so that the
- * event has inconsistent internal state.
- *
- * To solve this we have to use the other field to lock the event. Currently
- * this is implemented as a spinlock, but I'm not sure if a futex might be
- * better. I'm also not sure if it's possible to obviate locking by arranging
- * writes and reads in a certain way.
- *
- * Note that we don't have to worry about locking in esync_wait_objects().
- * There's only two general patterns:
- *
- * WaitFor()    SetEvent()
- * -------------------------
- * read()
- * signaled = 0
- *              signaled = 1
- *              write()
- * -------------------------
- * read()
- *              signaled = 1
- * signaled = 0
- *              <no write(), because it was already signaled>
- * -------------------------
- *
- * That is, if SetEvent() tries to signal the event before WaitFor() resets its
- * signaled state, it won't bother trying to write(), and then the signaled
- * state will be reset, so the result is a consistent non-signaled event.
- * There's several variations to this pattern but all of them are protected in
- * the same way. Note however this is why we have to use interlocked_xchg()
- * event inside of the lock.
- */
-
-/* Removing this spinlock is harder than it looks. esync_wait_objects() can
- * deal with inconsistent state well enough, and a race between SetEvent() and
- * ResetEvent() gives us license to yield either result as long as we act
- * consistently, but that's not enough. Notably, esync_wait_objects() should
- * probably act like a fence, so that the second half of esync_set_event() does
- * not seep past a subsequent reset. That's one problem, but no guarantee there
- * aren't others. */

+ * applications rely on it. This means we need to refcount handles, and defer
+ * deleting them on the server side until the refcount reaches zero. We do this
+ * by having each client process hold a handle to the fast synchronization
+ * object, as well as a private refcount. When the client refcount reaches zero,
+ * it closes the handle; when all handles are closed, the server deletes the
+ * fast synchronization object.
+ *
+ * We also need this for signal-and-wait. The signal and wait operations aren't
+ * atomic, but we can't perform the signal and then return STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE
+ * for the wait—we need to either do both operations or neither. That means we
+ * need to grab references to both objects, and prevent them from being
+ * destroyed before we're done with them.
+ *
+ * We want lookup of objects from the cache to be very fast; ideally, it should
+ * be lock-free. We achieve this by using atomic modifications to "refcount",
+ * and guaranteeing that all other fields are valid and correct *as long as*
+ * refcount is nonzero, and we store the entire structure in memory which will
+ * never be freed.
+ *
+ * This means that acquiring the object can't use a simple atomic increment; it
+ * has to use a compare-and-swap loop to ensure that it doesn't try to increment
+ * an object with a zero refcount. That's still leagues better than a real lock,
+ * though, and release can be a single atomic decrement.
+ *
+ * It also means that threads modifying the cache need to take a lock, to
+ * prevent other threads from writing to it concurrently.
+ *
+ * It's possible for an object currently in use (by a waiter) to be closed and
+ * the same handle immediately reallocated to a different object. This should be
+ * a very rare situation, and in that case we simply don't cache the handle.
