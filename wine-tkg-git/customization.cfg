##   For deeper configuration, see wine-tkg-profiles/advanced-customization.cfg
##

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to the desired installation path for your build(s). A versioned dir containing your build will be created inside that target.
# Example: _nomakepkg_prefix_path="/home/frog" will install your build in /home/frog/wine-tkg-********
_nomakepkg_prefix_path=""

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"


#### EXTERNAL INSTALLATION SETTINGS - !! ONLY AFFECTS MAKEPKG !! ####

# Set to true to install into external path instead of /usr. This allows you to install multiple different versions in parallel.
# !!! Don't forget that you'll have to use /opt/wine-something/bin/wine instead of just wine (same for winecfg etc.) !!!
_EXTERNAL_INSTALL="false"


#### WINE FLAVOUR SETTINGS ####

# plain wine commit (short) or version tag if you want to use a specific wine version. Can use e.g. "64d9f30", "wine-3.16" or "wine-4.0"
# !!! Only affects non-staging builds (you want to edit the staging_version below for staging builds) !!!
# Leave empty to use latest master - https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/commits/master
_plain_version=""

# staging
_use_staging="true"
# staging commit (short) or version tag if you want to use a specific staging version. Can use e.g. "7cfceb7", "v3.16" or "v4.0"

# !!! You need to use wine DXGI for VKD3D to work (remove your dxgi.dll override if any on the prefix you want to use VKD3D on, basically) !!!
_use_vkd3d="true"

# Set to false to add DXVK configuration support to Wine's DXGI, allowing for VKD3D to run while keeping DXVK dxgi functionalities.
