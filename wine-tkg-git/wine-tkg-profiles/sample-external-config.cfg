# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Wine-TkG config file - external config example

##
##   This config file is an example of external config (typical path: ~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg)
##   It contains all available options in a centralized way
##

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to the desired installation path for your build(s). A versioned dir containing your build will be created inside that target.
# Example: _nomakepkg_prefix_path="/home/frog" will install your build in /home/frog/wine-tkg-********
_nomakepkg_prefix_path=""

# Set to true to disable versioning in the installation path of your builds. To change the base name of your build dir, see _PKGNAME_OVERRIDE option.
_nomakepkg_nover="false"
