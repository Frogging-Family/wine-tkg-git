# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Wine-TkG advanced config file

##
##   This config file contains advanced settings for your build.
##   For the basic configuration, see ../customization.cfg
##

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to disable versioning in the installation path of your builds. To change the base name of your build dir, see _PKGNAME_OVERRIDE option.
_nomakepkg_nover="false"


#### MAKEPKG-ONLY OPTIONS (Will ONLY affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to "true" to add rt prio capability to wineserver
_allow_server_rt_prio="false"

# Set to "true" to add net raw capability to wineserver & wine preloaders
# Notably fixes empty pings on BF4 that may lead to kicks on some servers
_allow_wine_net_raw="false"


#### COMPILER/BUILD OPTIONS ####

# External config file to use - If the given file exists in path, it will override default config (customization.cfg) - Default is ~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg
_EXT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg

# Set to a string of your choice to override the default dynamic pkgname. Example: "awkward_frog" will result in "wine-tkg-git-awkward_frog" pkgname. You can also use "none" to only get a plain "wine-tkg-git" pkgname.
# On non-makepkg builds, it'll change the base name of the build's dir in a similar fashion.
_PKGNAME_OVERRIDE=""

# Custom compiler root dirs - Leave empty to use system compilers
# Example: CUSTOM_MINGW_PATH="/home/frog/PKGBUILDS/mostlyportable-gcc/mingw-mostlyportable-9.2.0"

# Set to true to use custom flags defined by _GCC_FLAGS and _LD_FLAGS. All CPU threads will also be used for building independently of your settings.
# Setting this to false will use your system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf (not recommended).
_LOCAL_OPTIMIZED="true"
# Custom GCC flags to use instead of system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf. Default is "-pipe -O2 -ftree-vectorize". Don't use -march=native if you want to share your builds accross different machines!

_ENABLE_TESTS="false"

# Strip libs for smaller footprint (--strip-unneeded) - Not recommended for debugging
_pkg_strip="true"

#### EXTERNAL INSTALLATION SETTINGS - !! ONLY AFFECTS MAKEPKG !! ####

# "opt" path

#### WINE FLAVOUR SETTINGS ####

# Set to the path of a custom wine source repo if desired. Leave empty to use official wine source.

# ! Make sure to disable staging if your source isn't compatible with it or it will fail to apply !
_custom_wine_source=""

# To build a local source instead of cloning from wine repos, copy the root dir of your build to wine-tkg-git/wine-tkg-git/src/ and set the variable below to the name of that dir
# Example: For a "wine-froggy" dir containing my wine source, I copy it to wine-tkg-git/wine-tkg-git/src/wine-froggy and set _localbuild="wine-froggy"
# Leave empty to use wine repos (default)
_localbuild=""

_fsync_spincounts="true"

# staging
# You can optionally uncomment the _staging_userargs="" option below to disable desired wine-staging patchsets.
# For example, to disable the 'wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending' patchset, the line below would look like this : _staging_userargs="-W wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending"
# You can also disable multiple patchsets ('wined3d-WINED3D_RS_COLORWRITEENABLE' and 'wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending' in the following example : _staging_userargs="-W wined3d-WINED3D_RS_COLORWRITEENABLE -W wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending"
