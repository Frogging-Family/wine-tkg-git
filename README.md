WINE-tkg patch for FL Studio 20.8.x

If you:

- use Arch (based) install .pkg.tar.zst

- use it with Lutris (especially if you aren't on Arch) extract .7z to /home/(your user name)/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/

- want to build it from original source then look at " How.to.build.wine-tkg.for.FLS.20-8 "

/Thanks to @Tk-Glitch @redgloboli
